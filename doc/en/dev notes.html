pycasm aims: 

1) .pyc file generation, 2) low-level language for a VM.
The first one includes commands for byte-generation: i3 to genererate '69 03 00 00 00' or just 3 to generate '03 00 00 00'.
The sequence of bytes generated isn't necessary runnable by a VM.
The second approach makes a correspondance between a command and VM action, commands like 'generate bytes of i3'
don't make a sense, instead you describe VM action in form like 'here goes constants: i3, here goes globals: i12, then the
following opcodes as a string '...', understood? run this code'.
The aims we want to persue define the language (as a most convinient tool to achieve the aim).

why pycasm is not byte-generation tool
	* it requires the structure of input to mimic .pyc file structure
	* it's syntax tries to keep and reflect the sematic meaning of the program (VM actions, not higher)


from a bird's eye view

pycasm code -&gt; ... -&gt; python bytecode
some requirements:
	*must work with UnPyc disasm output
    ~ UnPyc disasm output may (and probably will) have a separate parser and to byte-code compiler which shares code with pycasm


from command line

pycasm filename.pyc.asm
	writes pyc file to filename.pyc
pycasm filename_wo_ext
	writes pyc file to filename_wo_ext.pyc
pycasm filename -o ofname.pyc
	writes pyc file to ofname.pyc
pycasm -d filename.pyc
	writes filename.pyc.asm


from python interpreter
	...


pycasm implementation tools

	* all grammars are written in <a style="color:#204A87" href="#antlr">antlr</a>
	* all actions are written in java
		* python target of <a style="color:#204A87" href="#antlr">antlr</a> seems poor (but I have no examples)
	* alt: if actions are written in python
		-&gt; fewer tools and platforms
		-&gt; we can make a python module of pycasm and use it not just via command line but as a normal python module (which is more convinient for unpyc module)
			^ what about <a style="color:#204A87" href="#antlr">antlr</a>4, is there a python target, is it better?
		^ does it deserve to give a try?
	-&gt; all supportive code is written in java

pycasm assembler sematic structures

	* bytegeneration command, including typed bgen, strings
	* symnames, including opcodes
	* directives
	* template directives, which are constrained directives
	* scopes
		scope is a mapping from names to their defenitions:
			symname -&gt; defenition
			directive name -&gt; defenition
			scope name -&gt; defenition
		f.e. scope of directive .code (which is just a string in .pyc),
		contains all cpvm opcodes which can't be used outside this directive (and scope)
			* directive arguments scope
				1) arguments are preferably defined in directive's scope
				2) for each positional argument of a directive there is a defenitive
				   accordance to the scope of it's defenition
				f.e. .codeobject one one two nofree
				'one' and 'two' are symnames defined in parent scope
				'nofree' is a flag opcode defined inside the scope .codeobject.flags
				-&gt; directive desides which scope to use! but conforms to the rules above
		Can be and if can then how names be redefined?
			* default opcodes (symnames) can be redefined in some descendant scope but in a noticable way (templates don't afford this)
				(it's not a pleasure to debug a code for a few hours to finally find out that something which was default for ages is now different)
				f.e. it can be used for instrumenting each opcode with a trace message
			* descendant scopes can't redefine scopes of its ancestors (but can redefine names of ancestors) // bla bla bla
			f.e.
			.define pop_top
				print 'pop top'
				pop_top			&lt;- previous one, no recursion
		Are scopes a mapping from strings to some type or we need more than a string, some type info attached mb?
			* Nope, name is just a plain name, nothing attached, all info about type is in definiton
		

pycasm assembler language

	* try to keep names close to
		1) .pyc file representations
		2) standard modules (dis, marshal)
		3) python sources
		4) python, jasmin, tasm
	 Some syntax rules which are hold in unpyc and p.modules
	 ! opcodes mnemonics are UPPERCASED, (dis module, unpyc)
	   names of code fields are lowercased,
	   python names are MixedCased (None, NoneType)
	^^ for pycasm may be inconvinient if case-switching occures too often

	* try to keep code structure close to structure of .pyc file

	? type syntax
		unpyc format:
			tuple:, code: &lt;- looks like a label
		type(..) format:
			'str', 'code', 'NoneType'
		python interpreter format:
			&lt;type 'str'&gt;, &lt;code object &lt;module&gt;&gt;, &lt;module 'dis'&gt;, &lt;class '...'&gt;
		jasmin format:
			.code [name] &lt;descriptor&gt;
			or
			.field [name] &lt;descriptor&gt;
			or
			L/some/path()V;
			f.e.
				.field code s
				.code s
				.code __main__ s
				.consts (4
				.consts ?12 		&lt;- for unknown type represented by byte 12
				
				repetitions or sizes format
					s15, s(15), 15 rep s, s 15
					size format can take 2 words: saabbccdd &lt;- what a mess
					s aa bb cc dd
				
	* type format
			take .pyc one-byte representation of a type
			make char of it if possible, some escape sequence if not
			* UnPyc way is: "TYPE:", "type:", "t:value"

	* hackety vs rigid syntax
			if you restrict programmer from doing what he wants then ... isn't it just boring not to try to write wrong bc for a vm and see what'll happen
			-&gt; you can write what you want, but you have to do it in a clear, understandable way

	* 'There should be one -- and preferably only one -- obvious way to do it.'
			  -&gt; you can't write 'blabla' anywhere you want, syntax won't let you do that
			  ! this beats hackety

	* single way vs hackety
			language syntax lets you define existing structures in a correct way, which is the only one
			language syntax lets you make your own structures which are explicitly different (in syntax,
			not nec. in semantics) from all the defined structures

	* directives
			'.' directive_name [directive_positional_arguments]
				[directive body]

	* template directives
			what is a template directive?
			it's like a string template or macro, which takes parameters, optional, positional, m.b. named and generates bytecode.
			# template directive definition proposal
			# what distinguishes directive from a traditional template is that you can supply not just some arguments and get holed or end definition
			# (definition as a sequence of bytes conforming to some structure) but you can supply the whole definition, byte by byte,
			# which still conforms to template directive's structure.
			So, t.directive is defined by it's name, structure and arguments: neccessary, optional and their default values.

			Do we need t.directives which bytes can't be redefined?
			this idea is rejected --&gt; 1) This is against hackety but we do need them for convinience,
			this type of t.directive supply guarantee that generated bc conforms not just in a sense all required fields are
			defined, but that they are defined with correct byte values. For those who want to hack -- define your own
			directive and use instead of rigid one.
			this idea is rejected --&gt; 2) More, we need some reference mechanism, some way to define filled structure which we can use in multiple
			places as an argument for another template (directive). If you reference this filled template by a name
			then you definitely can't redefine any byte of it, it can be considered as a such type of a fixed directive.
			?&gt; why not? if field redefinition is explicit and not obscured then no guarantee are broken -- all redefinitions are
			clear, observable and highly noticable. &lt;-- redefinable t.directives are accepted
			
			more technical defenition
				t.directive can be described by a grammar, but actually it is so simple that we don't need one
				t.directive consists of sections (template's holes)
				each section can be defined by multiple ways:
					1) positional argument
					2) in body definition
					3) with default value (may be empty)
				sections can't be permutated, but may be skipped (with a 'skip' directive, or '...' )

				diriective forms:
					expanded
						all arguments are supplied via body and never inline
					inline
						none arguments are supplied via body
					full expanded
						expanded and all optional arguments are supplied

				how may directive structure be presented
				1) it's a tree
				2) subdirectives (sections) are scope-dependent (namespaces is a great idea)
					f.e. ??? (any good example)
					.scope [scope name]
						[scope body]
					[.end scope name]
					
					t.d. are not just scope dependent, this scope makes constrains the order of it's child directives
					t.d. is:
						the way we parse arguments (DIR)
						possible subs-s in a fixed order &lt;- here come types
							some of which obligatory, other optional
							some have defaults, routines to cals them
					What is the neat python implementation for t.d.scopes?
						* a list
							[.kwargs, .args, .flags, .stacklimit, .code ...]
							too simple
								we need also: default args, [non]obligatory subsecs
						
				f.e.
					.object
						.type
							directive
						.name
							codeobject
						.sections
							.nlocals
								.default
									0
							.stacksize
								.default
									0
							.flags
								.default
									nofree
							.consts
							.varnames
							.cellvars
						.arguments
							.number
								4
							.required
								0 &lt;-- .end requires one argument
						.definition
							{code for args parsing, default values calculation}
					.end object
						

	LIST OF DIRECTIVES

		.end &lt;directive_name&gt;
			does nothing, used to mark the end of directive's long body

		# template directives (macro directives)

		.&lt;tdirective_name&gt; [args]
			[tdirective's body]

		.python [version]
			generates python's version stamp

		.stamp [timestamp]
			generates pyc-file stamp

		.consts [&lt;'('&gt;number_of_consts] [first_consts]
			generates bc of type .consts, which can be used in .codeobject
			f.e.
			.consts '('1 s'string constant'
			.consts '('999 t'let\'s start'
				.object c
				'i'5
				&lt;and so on&gt;
		def consts():
			.size, .object{.size}

		.codeobject
			subtemplates: .type, .argcount, .nlocals, .stacksize, .flags, .code, .consts, .names, .varnames, .freevars, .cellvars, .filename, .name, .firstlineno, .lnotab

		# low level directives (trivial or no structure)

		.object [type] [first_values]
			generates code for object of type .type
			f.e.
			.object 'c' 1 1 1 nofree
				generates: 'c' 1 1 1 1 nofree
			.object 'c' 1 1 1 nofree
				.put u'even more'
				generates: 'c' 1 1 1 1 nofree u'even more'

		.put [byte_generation_sequence]
			just puts sequence of bytes on the hole
			f.e.
			.put 'c' 1 1 1 nofree
				generates 'c' 1 1 1 1 nofree


NOTES ON SYNTAX

.type_notation

	.first_type
		&lt;encoding_prefix&gt;'&lt;content&gt;'
			encoding is a way of presenting information as data
			quotes denote sequence of characters and encoding is applied to each character regardless of it's context
			so f'1.2' is incorrect since f encoding can't be applied to '.'
			-&gt; this syntax is used for string types only
			f.e.
				u8'utf string content'
			empty strings are not allowed, use second_type syntax

	.second_type
		'&lt;type_in_ascii&gt;'&lt;content_suffix&gt;
			f.e.
				'i'8 &lt;- integer type followed by type content for 8 (which is an argument)
				empy argument maps to type_in_ascii...
				how about multiple arguments?
					f.e. for dict would be handy to use {'a':2} or dict(**kwargs) syntax
						! syntax of pycasm and python should divirge if it has different semantics
							pycasm types are processed by pycasm    &gt;
							python types are preocessed by python       &gt;  different semantics
							^ you can make them just a bit different to mark that fact
								f.e.
									dict(**kw) in python vs .dict(**kw) in pycasm
														^ inline directive, never has body
															^ omg, more work!
																^ do we need it?
				'f'2.3 &lt;- float type and it's content

	.type_directive
		f.e.
			.float 1.2					# as common directive
			ee .float(1.2) aa bb		# inline directive
			.dict(one='two')

.end type_notation

.directive_definition_notation

	directive is a part of pycasm semantic world, not python's
		-&gt; it has no bytecode representation, no AST
		-&gt; (currently) every directive takes AST and returns AST

	what language is used to describe AST-&gt;AST directive?
		python! that python in which you invoke your *asm.py...
			^ omg, I have to parse python
				^ just tokenize it as a single token and then eval
		pycasm? -&gt; not now

	how about .def
			f.e.
			.def stamp(AST_ARG, AST_BODY)
				... in python ...
				return AST_RESULT
		I like dot-names to indicate functions which result is placed 'here, at the dot'
		also it tricks me think that .def is a template directive which is filled for generating function definition, like .dict for dictionary
		^ 
	ok, how about ..def
		first dot indicates that we are pycasm directive
		second dot indicates
			that we don't fill any template directive, we are not template directive
			we are not bound to the ordered context (this is that)

.end directive_definition_notation

.end current_work

.arguments_syntax

	python style
		f.e.
			.some_directive(12, 13, 14)
		* (..,..,..) looks like tuple, cool
		* allows inline grouping `.str(.int(12))`, `.some_directive(11, .some_other(22, 33), 44))` vs `.some_directive 11 (.some_other 22 33) 44`
		* looks like a function call (it is actually)
		- passing a body misleads that it is a declaration of some function
	vs
	assembler style
		f.e.
			.str 12 13 14
		* looks like `opname argument` (`load_const 44`), nice
		* looks like a declaration (it is actually)
	
.end arguments_syntax

.references_syntax
	'''references are used to bring some deep nested code out to make it more readable'''
	1) reference generates some code to be pasted -&gt; it starts with one dot
	2) it corresponds to one and only one child of the parent restricted scope
	3) .reference some_unique_id_of_this_filled_template
	4) filled template which is being referenced is placed in some parent scope and is "unbound" that is it doesn't conform to restricted scope &lt;- starts with two dots
	5) f.e.
	.pycfile
		... some deep nested structure ...
			.here
				.reference here_first_child
			.end here
		...
	.end pycfile

	..fill here_here_first_child
.end




Bytecode to Pycasm

ways:
	1) <a style="color:#204A87" href="#antlr">antlr</a> grammar to parse pyc file in binary mode
		why? to keep all parsers uniform?
			to let other people reuse your grammar instead of using code in some high level language (which is often harder to understand and work with)
				<a style="color:#204A87" href="#antlr">antlr</a> grammar for pyc file would look like a shit (I think)
	2) parser in Python:
		1) make wrappers around marchal.c of different versions
			what is PyObject?
				some basic things: refcount, pointer to some base object (which?) ... whatever
			marchal.c exposed python methods return PyObject
				alt1: convert it to pycasm (extend pyObject with __asm__ method, hah)
				alt2: throw it away, digg in 'r_'-methods (like UnPyc)
			- you have to compile smth (but distutils just works for you)
			ok, compilable
			now, throw away PyObject, instrument 'r_'-methods
			the algo:
				read python version
				read python stamp
				depending on version load appropriate marshal module (which is got: 1) compiling marshal.c, 2) instrumenting it with to_asm method)
				pycasm_marshal.to_asm(file) or pycasm_marshal.to_asm(bytes)
				profit
			ok, but seems UnPyc works with PyObjects, we want to patch UnPyc
				then first write to_asm method for UnPyc
				
		2) write your own
		3) take that of UnPyc
		4) play with marshal from python
			bytecode -&gt; unmarshalize to python object -&gt; convert to asm... with dis, hah (UnPyc does exact this) &lt;- dis is written in python and small (easily modified)
